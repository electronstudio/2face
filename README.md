# 2face 

## Install

You need a Java Runtime Environment.  I suggest you install OpenJDK 11 JRE.
Alternatively you could use the JDK from Oracle, but it's a bigger download.

### Windows

Follow instructions at https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html#

### Mac

     brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
     brew cask install adoptopenjdk11-jre
     
### Debian

    apt install openjdk-11-jre
   
## Run

    java -jar 2face.jar gopher://circumlunar.space
